### 🧬 Technical Highlights:
* **State Management:** Uses variables to track and update player 'Health' and 'Hint Status' in real-time.
* **Economic Logic:** Implements a cost-benefit system where players must strategically spend 2 HP to unlock specific numerical hints.
* **Control Flow:** Utilizes a robust `do-while` loop and nested `if-else` branching to handle complex game states.
* **UX Feedback:** Features system auditory alerts (`\a`) and Unicode symbols (❤️) to enhance the command-line interface experience.
